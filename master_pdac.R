# Master script to run real data application of TGCA-PAAD

## Preprocessing
# Single cell data preprocessing
knitr::knit_child("real_data/00_sc_processing.Rmd")

## Step 1 Deconvolution
# We developed a consensus deconvolution method that integrates both bulk and single-cell reference datasets to enhance accuracy and robustness. 
knitr::knit_child("real_data/01_TCGA_processing_deconv.Rmd")

## Step 2 Mediation
# High-dimensional mediation analysis: identification of potential DNA methylation probes mediating the pathway between tobacco consumption and survival in PDAC patients
knitr::knit_child("real_data/02_TCGA_mediation.Rmd")

## Step 3 AMR research and AMR mediation effects estimation
# Detection of Aggregated Methylation Regions among DNA probes p-value  and estimation of mediated AMR effects
knitr::knit_child("real_data/03_TCGA_survival_deconv_tobacco_AMR.Rmd")

## Step 4 Correlation
# Correlation study between latent factors, immune profil, AMR
knitr::knit_child("real_data/04_TCGA_immune_AMR_correlation.Rmd")

## Step 5 Causality
#We implemented a causal discovery framework based on conditional independence tests to identify causal relationships among the following variables: tobacco exposure, mediating AMR, total immune infiltration, B cell infiltration proportion, dendritic cell infiltration proportion, and survival 
knitr::knit_child("real_data/05_causality.Rmd")

## Step 6 Serial mediation
# We sought to determine whether indirect effects exist between tobacco exposure and survival in PDAC patients through mediator chains (AMRâ€“immune infiltration pairs identified by causal discovery), acknowledging that in the context of multiple mediators the total effect can be decomposed by considering them simultaneously.
