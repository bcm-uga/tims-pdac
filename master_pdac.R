# Master script to run real data application of TGCA-PAAD
# to run this pipeline create a results/ folder in existing real_data/ folder
# for 00_sc_processing.Rmd you need to load from zenodo tcga_pdac_mediation/data/genref_hadaca3/00_peng_k_2019.rds, tcga_pdac_mediation/data/genref_hadaca3/00_raghavan_s_2021.rds
# for 01_TCGA_processing_deconv.Rmd you need to load from zenodo tcga_pdac_mediation/data/cometh_lot1/transcriptome/T_raw.rds, tcga_pdac_mediation/data/TCGA_PAAD/study_TCGA-PAAD_meth.rds, tcga_pdac_mediation/data/TCGA_PAAD/study_TCGA-PAAD_trscr.rds, tcga_pdac_mediation/data/TCGA_PAAD/PublishedSampleTable.csv, tcga_pdac_mediation/data/TCGA_PAAD/clinical.project-tcga-paad.2024-07-30/exposure.tsv


# ## Preprocessing
# # Single cell data preprocessing
rmarkdown::render("real_data/00_sc_processing.Rmd", run_pandoc = FALSE, clean = TRUE)

## Step 1 Deconvolution
# We developed a consensus deconvolution method that integrates both bulk and single-cell reference datasets to enhance accuracy and robustness. 
rmarkdown::render("real_data/01_TCGA_processing_deconv.Rmd", run_pandoc = FALSE, clean = TRUE)

## Step 2 Mediation
# High-dimensional mediation analysis: identification of potential DNA methylation probes mediating the pathway between tobacco consumption and survival in PDAC patients.
rmarkdown::render("real_data/02_TCGA_mediation.Rmd", run_pandoc = FALSE, clean = TRUE)

## Step 3 AMR research and AMR mediation effects estimation
# Detection of Aggregated Methylation Regions among DNA probes p-value  and estimation of mediated AMR effects
rmarkdown::render("real_data/03_TCGA_survival_deconv_tobacco_AMR.Rmd", run_pandoc = FALSE, clean = TRUE)

## Step 4 Correlation
# Correlation study between latent factors, immune profil, AMR
rmarkdown::render("real_data/04_TCGA_immune_AMR_correlation.Rmd", run_pandoc = FALSE, clean = TRUE)

## Step 5 Causality
#We implemented a causal discovery framework based on conditional independence tests to identify causal relationships among the following variables: tobacco exposure, mediating AMR, total immune infiltration, B cell infiltration proportion, dendritic cell infiltration proportion, and survival. 
rmarkdown::render("real_data/05_causality.Rmd", run_pandoc = FALSE, clean = TRUE)

## Step 6 Serial mediation
# We sought to determine whether indirect effects exist between tobacco exposure and survival in PDAC patients through mediator chains (AMRâ€“immune infiltration pairs identified by causal discovery), acknowledging that in the context of multiple mediators the total effect can be decomposed by considering them simultaneously.
rmarkdown::render("real_data/06_TCGA_serial_mediation_V2.Rmd", run_pandoc = FALSE, clean = TRUE)

# ## Step 7 Interpretation
#rmarkdown::render("real_data/07_AMR_biology.Rmd", run_pandoc = FALSE)
